      <h2>Hello, I'm Khush Soni</h2>
      <p>Welcome to my portfolio.I am an enthusiastic and motivated Information Technology student with a solid academic
        background and hands-on experience gained through internships and project work. Passionate about software
        development, web technologies, and automation systems, I enjoy solving problems and building efficient,
        user-friendly solutions.
      </p>
      <p>My journey includes a Diploma in IT from Silveroak University and I am currently pursuing a B.Tech in
        Information Technology. During my internships, I successfully contributed to automation solutions that improved
